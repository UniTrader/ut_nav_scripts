  <!--

 rewritten from scratch by UniTrader
  
  Generic routine for moving to a specific location.
  Will get the Path and call the relevant scripts for each movement Step.
  Will also start from the beginning if Target Object switched Zone Context to follow it until both are in the same Zone
  But will terminate if $destination is reached (no cheap follow mode, just getting there)
  No Movement done here directly, all is in a specific sub-script pere movement type (Gate passage, Jump, Boost, normal/exact
